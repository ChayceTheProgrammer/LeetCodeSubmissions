"""
Original Question:
Determine an LCS of X = ⟨R, H, U, B, A, R, B⟩ and
Y = ⟨S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y ⟩ using the dynamic programming algorithm
that was discussed in class. Make sure that you explain your answer step-by-
step, in detail, rather than just giving an LCS. [Make sure that you list X
vertically, and Y horizontally when constructing the table. If xi = yj , and
c[i − 1, j] = c[i, j − 1], choose c[i − 1, j]. Explain row-by-row how the table is
constructed.]
Why do we care? For every algorithm, you should make sure that you can work
it out step-by-step.
